# Damien_Hirst_Spot_Painting

Damien Hirst's spot paintings consist of colorful dots arranged in a grid on a white background. Each dot varies in size and color, creating a vibrant and eye-catching pattern. These works explore ideas of randomness and the nature of art.

Each painting is unique and randomly generated.
The program will prompt you to enter the number of dots you want to create for the painting.
The dots will be arranged in a grid pattern.
The color of each dot is randomly selected from a predetermined set of colors.
The size of each dot is fixed.
